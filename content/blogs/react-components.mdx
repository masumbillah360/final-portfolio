<Heading type="danger">Introduction</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, revolves around
    the concept of components. Understanding React components is pivotal for
    mastering React development. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the
    fundamentals of React components, exploring their types and best practices.
</Paragraph>

<Heading>What are React Components?</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    React components are modular, reusable entities that encapsulate UI elements
    and their behavior. They facilitate breaking down complex user interfaces
    into manageable parts, promoting code maintainability and reusability.
</Paragraph>

<Heading>Class Components vs. Functional Components</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    React offers two primary types of components: class components and
    functional components.
</Paragraph>

<Heading type="h3">Class Components</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Class components are ES6 classes extending the <code>React.Component</code>
    class. They define a <code>render()</code> method returning JSX to describe the
    component's UI. Class components can also manage state and utilize lifecycle
    methods.
</Paragraph>

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
    }
}
```

<Heading type="h3">Functional Components</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Functional components are JavaScript functions returning JSX. They are
    simpler and lighter than class components and can utilize React Hooks for
    state management and lifecycle behavior.
</Paragraph>

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
    return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
};
```

<Heading>Props</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Props (short for properties) enable data passing from parent to child
    components in React. They are immutable and passed down the component tree,
    allowing for component reusability and customization based on received data.
</Paragraph>

```jsx
const Greeting = (props) => {
    return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
};

<Greeting name="Alice" />;
```

<Heading>State</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    State is a crucial feature in React, representing the internal data of a
    component. It enables components to manage and update their data
    dynamically. Class components utilize the <code>setState()</code> method for
    state updates, while functional components leverage the{' '}
    <code>useState()</code> Hook.
</Paragraph>

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                Count: {this.state.count}
                <button
                    onClick={() =>
                        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
                    }>
                    Increment
                </button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    React components serve as the cornerstone of React development, enabling the
    creation of modular and scalable user interfaces. Understanding the diverse
    types of components, along with props and state management, is imperative
    for building robust React applications.
