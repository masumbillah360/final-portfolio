<Heading type="danger">Introduction</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Forms are a fundamental part of web applications, allowing users to input
    data and interact with the application. In this tutorial, we'll explore how
    to build dynamic and interactive forms in React. We'll cover form elements,
    form validation, and form submission, equipping you with the knowledge to
    create powerful forms for your React applications.
</Paragraph>

<Heading>Form Elements</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    React provides a set of form elements that allow you to collect user input,
    such as text input, `checkboxes`, radio buttons, and `dropdowns`. These form
    elements are similar to their HTML counterparts but are implemented as React
    components.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Let's create a simple form with text input and a submit button:
</Paragraph>

```jsx
// Form.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Form = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
                type="text"
                value={name}
                onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
                placeholder="Enter your name"
            />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
};

export default Form;
```

<Heading>Form Validation</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Form validation is an essential aspect of building robust forms, ensuring
    that users provide valid input before submitting the form. React provides
    various techniques for form validation, including built-in HTML validation
    attributes, custom validation logic, and third-party libraries.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Let's add simple validation to our form to ensure the user enters a name:
</Paragraph>

```jsx
// Form.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Form = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');
    const [error, setError] = useState('');

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        if (name.trim() === '') {
            setError('Please enter your name');
            return;
        }
        alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
                type="text"
                value={name}
                onChange={(e) => {
                    setName(e.target.value);
                    setError('');
                }}
                placeholder="Enter your name"
            />
            {error && <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</span>}
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
};

export default Form;
```

<Heading>Form Submission</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Handling form submission in React involves capturing form data and sending
    it to a server or processing it locally. You can use the `onSubmit` event
    handler to intercept form submission and execute custom logic, such as
    validating input or sending data to a `backend` API.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Let's enhance our form to handle form submission and display a success
    message:
</Paragraph>

```jsx
// Form.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Form = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');
    const [error, setError] = useState('');
    const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        if (name.trim() === '') {
            setError('Please enter your name');
            return;
        }
        setSubmitted(true);
    };

    return (
        <>
            {submitted ? (
                <p>Thank you for submitting, {name}!</p>
            ) : (
                <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                    <input
                        type="text"
                        value={name}
                        onChange={(e) => {
                            setName(e.target.value);
                            setError('');
                        }}
                        placeholder="Enter your name"
                    />
                    {error && <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</span>}
                    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
                </form>
            )}
        </>
    );
};

export default Form;
```
