<Heading type="danger">Introduction</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Client-side routing is a crucial aspect of modern web development, enabling
    seamless navigation and user experience in single-page applications. React
    Router is a popular routing library for React that allows you to implement
    client-side routing with ease. In this tutorial, we'll explore React Router
    and learn how to enhance user experience by implementing client-side routing
    in React applications.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Getting Started with React Router</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    React Router provides a declarative way to define routes in your React
    application and render different components based on the URL. It offers
    components like <code>`BrowserRouter`</code>, <code>Route</code>, and{' '}
    <code>Link</code> to manage navigation and state.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Let's set up React Router in a simple React application:</Paragraph>

<CallOut>npm install react-router-dom</CallOut>

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Contact from './Contact';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Router>
            <div>
                <nav>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </nav>

                <Switch>
                    <Route path="/about">
                        <About />
                    </Route>
                    <Route path="/contact">
                        <Contact />
                    </Route>
                    <Route path="/">
                        <Home />
                    </Route>
                </Switch>
            </div>
        </Router>
    );
};

export default App;
```

<Paragraph>
    In this example, we set up a basic React application with React Router. We
    use the <code>`BrowserRouter`</code> component as the root router, and{' '}
    <code>Route</code> components to define routes for different paths. We also
    use the <code>Link</code> component to create navigation links.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Nested Routes and Route Parameters</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    React Router supports nested routes and route parameters, allowing you to
    create complex routing structures and dynamic routes in your application.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Let's see how to define nested routes and access route parameters:
</Paragraph>

```// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import Product from './Product';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/products">Products</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <Switch>
          <Route path="/products/:id">
            <Product />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/">
            <Home />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

<Paragraph>
    In this example, we define a nested route for products with a route
    parameter <code>:id</code>. We can then access the product ID from the URL
    in the <code>Product</code> component using React Router's{' '}
    <code>`useParams`</code> hook.
</Paragraph>

<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    React Router is a powerful library for implementing client-side routing in
    React applications. By defining routes, nested routes, and route parameters,
    you can create dynamic and user-friendly navigation experiences. In this
    tutorial, we've explored the basics of React Router and learned how to
    implement client-side routing in React applications.
