<Heading type="danger">Introduction</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Building modern web applications often requires a combination of `frontend`
    and `backend` technologies. Express.js, a minimalist and flexible Node.js
    framework, serves as an excellent choice for creating powerful `backend`
    `APIs` and handling server-side logic. When combined with React, a popular
    `frontend` library known for its component-based architecture and
    declarative approach, developers can build full-stack web applications that
    offer a seamless user experience.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Setting Up the Project</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Before we dive into the integration of Express.js and React, let's set up a
    new project and install the necessary dependencies. We'll use{' '}
    <code>create-react-app</code> to generate the `frontend` and{' '}
    <code>express-generator</code> to scaffold the `backend`.
</Paragraph>

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir full-stack-app
cd full-stack-app

# Generate the frontend using create-react-app
npx create-react-app client

# Scaffold the backend using express-generator
npx express-generator server
cd server
npm install
```

<Paragraph>
    Now that we have our project structure in place, with the `frontend`
    generated in the <code>client</code> directory and the `backend` scaffolded
    in the <code>server</code> directory, let's proceed with integrating
    Express.js and React.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Integrating Express.js with React</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    To integrate Express.js with React, we'll serve the React application as
    static files from the Express server. This approach allows us to handle both
    `frontend` and `backend` logic within the same project structure.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Let's configure Express.js to serve the React application:
</Paragraph>

```javascript
// server/app.js

const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the React app
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/build')));

// Define API routes
app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
    res.send({ message: 'Welcome to the Express.js backend!' });
});

// Serve the React app on all other routes
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../client/build/index.html'));
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

<Paragraph>
    In this configuration, we serve the static files from the React build
    directory using `Express`'s <code>express.static</code> `middleware`. We
    define an API route at <code>/api</code> to handle `backend` logic, and all
    other routes are redirected to the React application's{' '}
    <code>index.`html`</code>.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>`Proxying` API Requests from React to Express</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    During development, it's common to run the React `frontend` and Express
    `backend` servers separately. To avoid `CORS` issues and simplify the
    development `workflow`, we can proxy API requests from the React application
    to the Express server.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Modify the <code>client/package.`json`</code> file to include a proxy
    configuration:
</Paragraph>

```json
// client/package.json

{
  "name": "client",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000",
  ...
}
```

<Paragraph>
    With this proxy configuration, any API requests from the React application
    will be forwarded to the Express server running on port 5000 during
    development.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Creating API Endpoints with Express</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    With the integration of Express.js and React in place, we can now create API
    endpoints to handle data retrieval, manipulation, and other server-side
    tasks. These endpoints can be defined in separate route files within the
    Express application.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Here's an example of defining a simple API endpoint in Express:
</Paragraph>

```javascript
// server/routes/api.js

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/data', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'This is sample data from the Express backend.' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

<Paragraph>
    We can then mount this router in the main Express application:
</Paragraph>

```javascript
// server/app.js

const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const apiRouter = require('./routes/api');

const app = express();

// Serve static files from the React app
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/build')));

// Mount API routes
app.use('/api', apiRouter);

// Serve the React app on all other routes
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../client/build/index.html'));
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

<Paragraph>
    With this setup, requests to <code>/api/data</code> will be handled by the{' '}
    <code>`apiRouter`</code>, allowing us to encapsulate and organize our
    `backend` logic effectively.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Integrating Express.js with React opens up a world of possibilities for
    building powerful full-stack web applications. By combining the robust
    `backend` capabilities of Express.js with the dynamic `frontend` features of
    React, developers can create seamless and scalable web experiences that
    cater to a wide range of use cases.

<Paragraph>
    In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of integrating Express.js with
    React, including serving the React application from the Express server,
    `proxying` API requests during development, and defining API endpoints to
    handle `backend` logic. Armed with this knowledge, you're well-equipped to
    embark on your journey of building full-stack web applications with
    Express.js and React.
