<Heading type="danger">Introduction</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Building modern web applications often requires a combination of `frontend`
    and `backend` technologies. Next.js, a powerful React framework, serves as
    an excellent choice for creating full-stack web applications with
    server-side rendering, routing, and other advanced features built-in. When
    combined with React, a popular `frontend` library known for its
    component-based architecture and declarative approach, developers can build
    seamless and scalable web applications that offer an exceptional user
    experience.

<Heading>Setting Up the Project</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Before we dive into the integration of Next.js and React, let's set up a new
    project and install the necessary dependencies. We'll use{' '}
    <code>create-next-app</code> to generate the Next.js application.
</Paragraph>

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir full-stack-app
cd full-stack-app

# Generate the Next.js application
npx create-next-app .

# Install additional dependencies
npm install
```

<Paragraph>
    Now that we have our project structure in place, with the Next.js
    application generated, let's proceed with integrating Next.js and React.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Creating API Routes with Next.js</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Next.js allows us to create API routes directly within our application,
    enabling us to handle server-side logic alongside `frontend` rendering. API
    routes in Next.js are defined in the <code>pages/api</code> directory and
    can be accessed like any other route.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Let's create a simple API route to handle `backend` logic:
</Paragraph>

```javascript
// pages/api/data.js

export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({
        message: 'This is sample data from the Next.js backend.',
    });
}
```

<Paragraph>
    With this setup, the API route will be accessible at <code>/api/data</code>{' '}
    relative to the application's root URL.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Fetching Data in the `Frontend`</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Next.js provides built-in functionality for fetching data in the `frontend`
    using methods like <code>`getStaticProps`</code> and{' '}
    <code>`getServerSideProps`</code>. These methods allow us to pre-render pages
    with data fetched at build time or request time, respectively.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Let's fetch data from our API route and display it in a React component:
</Paragraph>

```jsx
// pages/index.js

export default function Home({ data }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to the Next.js Application</h1>
            <p>{data.message}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
    const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/data');
    const data = await res.json();

    return {
        props: {
            data,
        },
    };
}
```

<Paragraph>
    In this example, we fetch data from the API route at build time using{' '}
    <code>`getStaticProps`</code>. The fetched data is then passed to the{' '}
    <code>Home</code> component as props.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Integrating Next.js with React offers a powerful solution for building
    full-stack web applications with ease. By leveraging Next.js' server-side
    rendering capabilities and built-in API routes, developers can create
    seamless and scalable web experiences that cater to a wide range of use
    cases.

    In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of integrating Next.js with
    React, including creating API routes, fetching data in the `frontend`, and
    rendering pages with pre-fetched data. Armed with this knowledge, you're
    well-equipped to embark on your journey of building full-stack web
    applications with Next.js and React.
