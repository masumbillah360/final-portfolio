<Heading type="danger">Introduction</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Building modern web applications often involves interacting with databases
    to store and retrieve data efficiently. `Prisma` ORM, a modern database
    toolkit, simplifies database access and data modeling by providing a
    type-safe and auto-generated query builder for Node.js and TypeScript
    applications. When integrated with Node.js, a popular `backend` runtime
    known for its performance and scalability, `Prisma` ORM enables developers
    to build powerful and scalable web applications with ease.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Setting Up the Project</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Before we dive into the integration of `Prisma` ORM with Node.js, let's set
    up a new project and install the necessary dependencies. We'll use{' '}
    <code>npm</code> to initialize a new Node.js project and install `Prisma`
    ORM.
</Paragraph>

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir prisma-node-app
cd prisma-node-app

# Initialize a new Node.js project
npm init -y

# Install Prisma CLI globally
npm install -g prisma

# Create a new Prisma project
prisma init
```

<Paragraph>
    Follow the prompts to set up your `Prisma` project, including selecting the
    database provider and configuring your database connection.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Defining the Data Model</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Once the `Prisma` project is initialized, we can define our data model using
    `Prisma` Schema Language. The data model defines the structure of our
    database tables and the relationships between them.
</Paragraph>

```prisma
// schema.prisma

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String @unique
  name  String
}
```

<Paragraph>
    In this example, we define a <code>User</code> model with <code>id</code>,{' '}
    <code>email</code>, and <code>name</code> fields. The <code>id</code> field
    serves as the primary key, and the <code>email</code> field is marked as
    unique to ensure data integrity.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Generating `Prisma` Client</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    After defining the data model, we need to generate the `Prisma` Client,
    which provides a type-safe API for interacting with the database. We can
    generate the `Prisma` Client using the `Prisma` CLI.
</Paragraph>

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate
```

<Paragraph>
    This command generates the `Prisma` Client in the{' '}
    <code>node_modules/@`prisma`/client</code> directory, allowing us to import
    and use it in our Node.js application.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Integrating `Prisma` with Node.js</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    With the `Prisma` Client generated, we can now integrate it with our Node.js
    application to perform database operations. Let's create a simple API
    endpoint to demonstrate how to use `Prisma` in a Node.js application.
</Paragraph>

```javascript
// index.js

const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
        res.json(users);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching users:', error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
    }
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

<Paragraph>
    In this example, we define an API endpoint to fetch all users from the
    database using `Prisma`'s <code>`findMany`</code> method. We create a new
    instance of the `Prisma` Client and use it to perform database queries
    asynchronously.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Integrating `Prisma` ORM with Node.js offers a powerful solution for
    building modern web applications with robust database capabilities. By
    leveraging `Prisma`'s type-safe query builder and auto-generated API,
    developers can streamline database access and simplify data modeling,
    leading to more efficient development `workflows` and scalable applications.

    In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of integrating `Prisma` ORM with
    Node.js, including setting up the project, defining the data model,
    generating the `Prisma` Client, and integrating `Prisma` with Node.js to
    perform database operations. Armed with this knowledge, you're well-equipped
    to embark on your journey of building modern web applications with `Prisma`
    ORM and Node.js.
