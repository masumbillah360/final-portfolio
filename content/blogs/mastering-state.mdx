<Heading type="danger">Introduction</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    State management is a critical aspect of building React applications,
    particularly as they scale in complexity. In this comprehensive guide, we'll
    explore advanced techniques for managing state in React, including the
    context API, `Redux`, and custom hooks. By understanding and mastering these
    techniques, you'll be equipped to build scalable and maintainable React
    applications.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>The Context API</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    The context API, introduced in React 16.3, provides a way to share data
    across the component tree without prop drilling. It offers a centralized
    location for storing and accessing shared data, making it ideal for managing
    global application state.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    Let's create a practical example using the context API to manage theme
    settings across components:
</Paragraph>

```jsx
// ThemeContext.js
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = createContext();

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

    const toggleTheme = () => {
        setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
    };

    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
            {children}
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
};

export const useTheme = () => {
    const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
    if (!context) {
        throw new Error('useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider');
    }
    return context;
};
```

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from './ThemeContext';
import ThemeToggle from './ThemeToggle';
import ThemedComponent from './ThemedComponent';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <ThemeProvider>
            <div>
                <ThemeToggle />
                <ThemedComponent />
            </div>
        </ThemeProvider>
    );
};

export default App;
```

<Paragraph>
    In this example, we create a theme context using `React`'s `createContext`()
    function. We then use a `ThemeProvider` component to manage the theme state
    and provide a `toggleTheme` function to update the theme. Finally, we use the
    `useTheme` hook to access the theme context and toggle the theme in our
    components.
</Paragraph>

<Heading>`Redux`</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    `Redux` is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications,
    commonly used with React for managing application state. It provides a
    centralized store for state management and enables predictable state
    mutations through reducers.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Let's see how we can integrate `Redux` into a React application:
</Paragraph>

<CallOut>npm install `redux react-redux`</CallOut>


```jsx
// store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;

```

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import Counter from './Counter';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Counter />
    </Provider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

<Paragraph>
    In this example, we create a `Redux` store using the `createStore`() function from `Redux`. We then wrap our entire application in a Provider component provided by `react-redux`, passing the store as a prop. This gives all components access to the `Redux` store and its state.
</Paragraph>

<Heading>Custom Hooks</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React for extracting and reusing `stateful` logic across components. They allow you to abstract complex logic into reusable functions, improving code maintainability and readability.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Let's create a custom hook for fetching data from an API:
</Paragraph>

```jsx
// useFetch.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const useFetch = (url) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading };
};

export default useFetch;
```
<Paragraph>
    In this example, we create a custom hook called `useFetch` that takes a URL as input and returns the fetched data and a loading state. We use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from the provided URL when the component mounts or when the URL changes.
</Paragraph>
<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    Advanced state management techniques are essential for building complex React applications. The context API, `Redux`, and custom hooks offer powerful tools for managing state in different scenarios. By mastering these techniques, you can create scalable and maintainable React applications.
